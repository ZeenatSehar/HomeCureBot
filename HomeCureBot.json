Rest. Avoid activities that cause pain, swelling, or discomfort.\n2. Ice. Use an ice pack or ice slush bath immediately for 15 to 20 minutes and repeat every two to three hours while you're awake. \n3. Compression. To help stop swelling, compress the ankle with an elastic bandage until the swelling stops. \n\nGET MEDICAL HELP IF:\nSevere pain when the injured part is touched or moved\nContinued trouble bearing weight\nMore bruising\n"

It can result from a sports injury, accident, or violent trauma.\n\n>>>HOW TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN FRACTURE AND SPRAIN?\nIf you’re experiencing pain around the soft tissue but not over your bone, it’s likely that you have a sprain and not a break.\n\nI guess u got fracture that needs to be plastered but u can FOLLOW THESE HOME REMEDIES to ease the pain which may give relief:\n1. Stop any bleeding: If they’re bleeding, elevate and apply pressure to the wound using a sterile bandage, a clean cloth, or a clean piece of clothing.\n2. Immobilize the injured area: If you suspect they’ve broken a bone in their neck or back, help them stay as still as possible. If you suspect they’ve broken a bone in one of their limbs, immobilize the area using a splint or sling.\n3. Apply cold to the area: Wrap an ice pack or bag of ice cubes in a piece of cloth and apply it to the injured area for up to 10 minutes at a time.\n\nWHEN TO SEEK MEDICAL HELP?\nIf the person doesn’t appear to be breathing, is unconscious, or both, call for medical help, and begin CPR. You should also call if:\nYou suspect they’ve broken a bone in their head, neck, or back\nThe fractured bone has pushed through their skin\nThey’re bleeding heavily"

For example, burns, abrasions, paper cuts, skin tears.\n\n>>>FIRST AID FOR WOUNDS\nThese guidelines can help you care for minor cuts and scrapes:\n1. Wash your hands. This helps avoid infection.\n2. Stop the bleeding. Minor cuts and scrapes usually stop bleeding on their own. If needed, apply gentle pressure with a clean bandage or cloth and elevate the wound until bleeding stops.\n3. Clean the wound. Rinse the wound with water. Keeping the wound under running tap water will reduce the risk of infection. Wash around the wound with soap. But don't get soap in the wound. And don't use hydrogen peroxide or iodine, which can be irritating. Remove any dirt or debris with a tweezers cleaned with alcohol. See a doctor if you can't remove all debris.\n4. Apply an antibiotic or petroleum jelly. Apply a thin layer of an antibiotic ointment or petroleum jelly to keep the surface moist and help prevent scarring. Certain ingredients in some ointments can cause a mild rash in some people. If a rash appears, stop using the ointment.\n5. Cover the wound. Apply a bandage, rolled gauze or gauze held in place with paper tape. Covering the wound keeps it clean. If the injury is just a minor scrape or scratch, leave it uncovered.\n6. Change the dressing. Do this at least once a day or whenever the bandage becomes wet or dirty.\n7. Get a tetanus shot. Get a tetanus shot if you haven't had one in the past five years and the wound is deep or dirty.\n8. Watch for signs of infection. See a doctor if you see signs of infection on the skin or near the wound, such as redness, increasing pain, drainage, warmth, or swelling.\n\nGET MEDICAL HELP IF:\nA body part, such as a fingertip, that is cut off. Put the part that was cut off in a sealed plastic bag right away. Put the bag in a container with ice water.\n"

How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with doctors, infection prevention and control experts, and public health officials and involves considering specifics of each situation including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for that patient. Current CDC guidance for when it is OK to release someone from isolation is made on a case by case basis and includes meeting all of the following requirements: The patient is free from fever without the use of fever-reducing medications. The patient is no longer showing symptoms, including cough. The patient has tested negative on at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected at least 24 hours apart. Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others."

Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure. For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure, because 14 days is the longest incubation period seen for similar coronaviruses. Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period."

Splinters usually are wood, but metal, glass, and plastic materials may be considered splinters.\n\n>>>  If the splinter is sticking out of the skin:\n\n1. Wash the skin around the splinter with soap and water.\n2. Clean a pair of tweezers with a cotton swab dipped in alcohol.\n3. Grab the end of the splinter with the tweezers.\n4. Pull it out at the same angle as the splinter went in.\n5. Clean the skin again with soap and water.\n\n\n>>> If the splinter is under the skin:\n\n1. Wash the skin around the splinter with soap and water.\n2. Clean a needle and tweezers with alcohol.\n3. Gently scrape away the skin above the splinter with the needle until you can see the top of the splinter.\n4. Grab the end of the splinter with the tweezers and pull it out at the same angle it went in.\n5. Clean the skin again with soap and water.\n\n>>> WHEN TO SEEK MEDICAL HELP?\n1. A splinter under a fingernail may be impossible to remove at home. Unless removed, it often becomes infected.\n2. Very deep splinters may require removal by a doctor. Some splinters may be lodged so deeply that only an anesthetic injection allows for a painless removal.\n3. Infection is usually noted with discharge (pus), increased pain, redness, swelling, or red streaking. This could be a sign that a foreign body has not been fully removed. All foreign bodies contain large amounts of germs. Even with complete removal and adequate cleansing, infection may still develop because the protective skin barrier was broken.\n4. Large splinters that interfere with sensation or movement have the potential for creating deep puncture wounds, which may embed in nerves and tendons (and even blood vessels)."

Both are treated in the same way.\n\nDIFFERENCE BETWEEN BURNS AND SCANDALS\nA burn is caused by dry heat – by an iron or fire, for example. A scald is caused by something wet, such as hot water or steam.\n\nTo treat a burn, follow the first aid advice below:\n1. Immediately get the person away from the heat source to stop the burning.\n2. COOL THE BURN with cool or lukewarm running water for 20 minutes – don't use ice, iced water, or any creams or greasy substances such as butter\n3.remove any clothing or jewelry that's near the burnt area of skin but doesn't move anything that's stuck to the skin.\n4. COVER THE BURNED area with a clean bandage that will not stick to the burned site. This helps decrease the risk of infection and decreases pain.\n5. Use painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen to treat any pain.\n6. If the face or eyes are burnt, sit up as much as possible, rather than lying down - this helps to reduce swelling.\n7. PROTECT THE BURN by keeping the burn site clean with gentle washing with soap and water.\n\n>>>WHEN DO BURNS REQUIRE SERIOUS MEDICAL ATTENTION?\nBurn or smoke-exposed patients may develop shortness of breath; inhalation of smoke and toxins may cause death, even if they have little or no skin burns. This shortness of breath is a medical emergency, even in people that have little or no skin or mucus membrane burns."

The nose contains many blood vessels, which are located close to the surface in the front and back of the nose. They’re very fragile and bleed easily. Nosebleeds are common in adults and children between the ages of 3 and 10.\n\n>>>CAUSES OF NOSEBLEED:\na foreign object stuck in the nose\nchemical irritants\nallergic reaction\ninjury to the nose\nrepeated sneezing\npicking the nose\ncold air\nupper respiratory infection\nlarge doses of aspirin\nSevere causes of nosebleeds include:\nhigh blood pressure\nbleeding disorders\nblood clotting disorders\ncancer\n\n\n>>>FIRST AID REMEDIES (Anterior Bleed):\nWhile sitting up, squeeze the soft part of your nose.\nMake sure that your nostrils are fully closed. Keep your nostrils closed for 10 minutes, lean forward slightly, and breathe through your mouth.\nDon’t lie down when trying to stop a nosebleed. Lying down can result in swallowing blood and can irritate your stomach. Release your nostrils after 10 minutes and check to see if the bleeding has stopped. Repeat these steps if bleeding continues.\nYou can also apply a cold compress over the bridge of your nose or use a nasal spray decongestant to close off the small blood vessels.\n\n>>>HOW TO KNOW WHEN IT REQUIRES SERIOUS MEDICAL ATTENTION?\nMost nosebleeds don’t require medical attention. However, you should seek medical attention if your nosebleed lasts longer than 20 minutes, or if it occurs after an injury. This may be a sign of a posterior nosebleed, which is more serious.\nPosterior nosebleeds shouldn’t be treated at home. Contact your doctor immediately or go to the emergency room (ER) if you think you have a posterior nosebleed.\n"

            "Stay in touch with your child’s school. Many schools are adapting in-person lessons to online or virtual learning. Review assignments from the school, and help your child establish a reasonable pace for completing the work. You may need to assist your child with turning on devices, reading instructions, and typing answers. Communicate challenges to your school. If you face technology or connectivity issues, or if your child is having a hard time completing assignments, let the school know. Create a schedule and routine for learning at home, but remain flexible. Have consistent bedtimes and get up at the same time, Monday through Friday. Structure the day for learning, free time, healthy meals and snacks, and physical activity. Allow flexibility in the schedule—it’s okay to adapt based on your day. Consider the needs and adjustment required for your child’s age group. The transition to being at home will be different for preschoolers, K-5, middle school students, and high school students. Talk to your child about expectations and how they are adjusting to being at home versus at school. Consider ways your child can stay connected with their friends without spending time in person. Look for ways to make learning fun. Have hands-on activities, like puzzles, painting, drawing, and making things. Independent play can also be used in place of structured learning. Encourage children to build a fort from sheets or practice counting by stacking blocks. Practice handwriting and grammar by writing letters to family members. This is a great way to connect and limit face-to-face contact. Start a journal with your child to document this time and discuss the shared experience. Use audio books or see if your local library is hosting virtual or live-streamed reading events."

            "The key to slowing the spread of COVID-19 is to limit social interactions as much as possible. Parents should minimize play dates, and if held, parents should keep the groups small. Advise older children to hang out in a small group and to meet up outside rather than inside. It’s easier to keep and maintain space between others in outdoor settings, like parks. If you have small meetups, consider hanging out with another family or friend who is also taking extra measures to put distance between themselves and others (i.e. social distancing). Make sure children practice everyday preventive behaviors , such as cleaning and then disinfecting frequently touched surfaces. Remember, if children meet outside of school in bigger groups, it can put everyone at risk. This includes spring break and other group travel. Parents should help their older children revise spring break plans that included non-essential travel to crowded areas. Information about COVID-19 in children is somewhat limited, but current data suggest children with COVID-19 may show only mild symptoms. However, they can still pass this virus onto others who may be at higher risk, including older adults and people who have serious chronic medical conditions"

Two other coronaviruses have emerged previously to cause severe illness in people (MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV). The virus that causes COVID-19 is more genetically related to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV, but both are betacoronaviruses with their origins in bats. While we don’t know for sure that this virus will behave the same way as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, we can use the information gained from both of these earlier coronaviruses to guide us. In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures. Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with imported goods and there have not been any cases of COVID-19 in the United States associated with imported goods. Information will be provided on the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) website as it becomes available."

Without proper treatment, malaria episodes (fever, chills, sweating) can return periodically over a period of years. After repeated exposure, patients will become partially immune and develop a milder disease.\n\n>>>What is the treatment for malaria fever?\nChloroquine phosphate.\nChloroquine is the preferred treatment for any parasite that is sensitive to the drug. But in many parts of the world, the parasites that cause malaria are resistant to chloroquine, and the drug is no longer an effective treatment.\n\n>>>Which fruit can cure malaria?\nVitamin A and Vitamin C rich foods such as carrot, beetroots, papaya, fruits especially citrus fruits (e.g. orange, mausambi, pineapple, grapes, berries, lemon, etc), with vitamin B complex are very useful to boost immunity.\n\n>>>What is the fastest way to cure malaria?\nFollowing are some of the most effective home remedies for malaria:\nCinnamon. Anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties in cinnamon help in dealing with symptoms of malaria. \n1. Turmeric. \n2. Orange juice. \n3. Ginger. \n4. Sweet lime juice. \n5.
